# Html-Practice
This is my first Html code in git in this i build a Student Registration Form in a very basic structure.<br>
This form consist of student details like : Name, Rollno., Password, Branch, Section and Field.<br>
For Additional function buttons like: Submit, Reset.<br>
In future i will add CSS and Database to make it perfect, beautilful and useable Website.
